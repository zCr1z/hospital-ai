CONF_001,NBC,NABH,Fire_vs_Infection_Control,Fire_Exit,Clean_Zone,NBC requires fire exits to be public and unrestricted, while NABH requires clean zones to be access-controlled,Critical,Life_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: NBC mandates unrestricted fire egress, but NABH restricts access to maintain clean zoning.
CONF_002,AERB,NBC,Radiation_vs_Egress,Has_Radiation,Fire_Exit,AERB prohibits public passage through radiation-controlled areas, while NBC mandates continuous egress routes,Critical,Life_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: Fire exit routed through radiation-controlled space violates AERB safety norms.
CONF_003,AERB,NABH,Radiation_vs_Patient_Flow,Has_Radiation,Public_Accessible,AERB requires controlled access to radiation rooms, while NABH encourages direct patient access from waiting areas,Critical,Radiation_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: NABH patient flow conflicts with AERB access control for radiation safety.
CONF_004,AERB,NBC,MRI_vs_Building_Services,Is_MRI,Lift_Core,AERB prohibits MRI adjacency to vibration sources, while NBC encourages compact vertical core planning,Critical,Equipment_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: MRI vibration sensitivity conflicts with NBC core adjacency norms.
CONF_005,NBC,NABH,Exit_vs_Privacy,Fire_Exit,Patient_Privacy,NBC requires visible and direct exits, while NABH requires privacy buffers for patients,Major,Life_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: Fire exit visibility conflicts with NABH patient privacy requirements.
CONF_006,NABH,NBC,Workflow_vs_Egress,Dirty_Utility,Fire_Exit,NABH restricts dirty utilities from patient circulation, while NBC allows exits through service corridors,Major,Life_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: Dirty utility routing conflicts with fire egress permissibility.
CONF_007,AERB,NABH,MRI_Zoning_vs_Operational_Flow,Is_MRI,Staff_Only_Zone,AERB mandates strict MRI zoning, while NABH encourages shared staff circulation,Major,Magnetic_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: MRI zone control conflicts with NABH staff flow optimization.
CONF_008,NBC,AERB,Structural_vs_Shielding,Fire_Rated_Wall,Shielding_Provided,NBC fire-rated wall thickness conflicts with AERB radiation shielding requirements,Critical,Radiation_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: Required fire wall construction conflicts with radiation shielding specifications.
CONF_009,NABH,AERB,Patient_Comfort_vs_Safety,Waiting_Area,Is_MRI,NABH encourages nearby waiting areas, while AERB restricts public proximity to MRI,Critical,Magnetic_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: Patient waiting adjacency violates MRI magnetic field safety.
CONF_010,NBC,NABH,Corridor_Width_vs_Zoning,Minimum_Corridor_Width,Access_Control,NBC mandates minimum corridor widths for evacuation, while NABH zoning restricts corridor accessibility,Major,Life_Safety_First,Flag_Conflict,Conflict Detected: Corridor width compliance conflicts with NABH access control zoning.
