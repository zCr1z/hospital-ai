# 🏥 Hospital AI – Radiology Compliance Engine

A rule‑based, explainable AI prototype built for **InnoAI Hackathon 2026 (Industry Track)** in collaboration with  
**Camomile Healthcare Ventures Pvt. Ltd.**

This project demonstrates a **Phase‑1 Proof of Concept (PoC)** for an “Autopilot” system that assists hospital planners and architects in validating **radiology department designs** against complex healthcare regulations.

## 📌 Problem Statement Reference

**Camomile AI Challenge**  
> *“Build the ‘Autopilot’ for Hospital Design and Compliance – Move an industry from blueprints to intelligence.”*

Hospitals must comply with thousands of regulations from bodies such as:
- **NBC** (National Building Code)
- **AERB** (Atomic Energy Regulatory Board)
- **NABH** (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals)

Manual compliance checking is:
- Time‑consuming  
- Error‑prone  
- Discovered late during construction  

This leads to **compliance debt**, rework, delays, and massive financial loss.

Our goal is to demonstrate how **rule‑driven intelligence + explainability** can replace manual checking at early design stages.

## 🎯 Project Scope (Hackathon – Phase 1 Only)

This prototype focuses **only on Phase 1** of the challenge:

### ✔ Implemented
- Intelligent **Area Program** generation (table‑based)
- **Compliance Scorecard** (pass / fail / warning)
- **Rule Engine** driven by CSV datasets
- Clear **explainability** for every decision
- Radiology department as a **vertical slice**

### ❌ Out of Scope (Phase 2 – Not Implemented)
- CAD/DXF generation
- 3D stacking models
- Auto‑correction geometry
- BIM/Revit integration
